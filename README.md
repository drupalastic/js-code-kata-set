# An HTML SCSS and JAVASCIPT Playground for developers.

I prefer this against online platforms for four main reasons :
1. Its easier to use browsers dev tools to debug things
2. Its closer to real world
3. Live reload / refresh is a real time saver
4. I can use my favourite text editors live templates / snippets while practicing

recommended node version : 12.3.1 (We recommend NVM)

setup :
clone the repository
run `npm install`

once install completes
run `gulp watch`

index.html and script.js is used as it is. 
JS files are not processed because most browsers supports latest JS features. In case you are an IE-11 user - you may consider using https://github.com/drupalastic/HTML-SCSS-JS-Starterkit 

style.scss will be compiled to style.css. Browser will refresh automatically on change.
